# 👗 StyleSearch – Visual Fashion Search and Outfit Recommender

StyleSearch is a machine learning-powered visual search tool that helps users find fashion items similar to an uploaded image. It also suggests matching outfits using a blend of computer vision and metadata understanding.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python **3.8+** is installed.

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py

- ✅ Ensure the following folders are present alongside the code:

-- data/ (e.g., metadata CSVs)

-- embeddings/ (precomputed image embeddings)

-- images/ (downloaded fashion images)

## 💡 About the Project

- Upload any fashion image.

- The system finds visually similar products using MobileNet (or CLIP) and cosine similarity.

- It recommends matching outfits using multi-modal similarity (visual + metadata).

- Personalized suggestions improve as the user interacts.

- A trend-aware module highlights top fashion themes based on search patterns.
